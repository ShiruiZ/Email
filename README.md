# Email
sending and receiving email using python (sending from gmail only)
Need to turn on "Less secure app access" in https://myaccount.google.com/security before using it.

How to use:
1. open terminal, change to the directory where the email.py is.
2. If you want to send any attachment file, move the file to the working directory.
3. Type "python email.py" and you are ready to go!
